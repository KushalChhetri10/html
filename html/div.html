      <!-- here what happens is even div is a block element but inside it we have p as block which also take full width of page inside div but anchor tag is inline and strong tag is also inline due to which even div is block , anchor and strong comes in same line as they are inline inside div -->
      <p>This is a paragraph</p>
      <!-- It means anchor and strong tag only takes its width upto where it is , it doesnt depend upon div width -->
